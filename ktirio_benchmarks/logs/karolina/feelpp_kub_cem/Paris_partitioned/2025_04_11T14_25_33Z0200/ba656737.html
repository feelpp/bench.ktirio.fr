Warning: Failed to solve nonlinear system using Newton solver.

  Tag: extended initialization.nonlinear[1]

  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - This may be caused by initial conditions not being fully specified, check the translation log.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution, see homotopy in the manual.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.
  Especially consider the first two items above when the nonlinear solver fails during initialization.

     - This may be caused by initial conditions not being fully specified, check the translation log.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution, see homotopy in the manual.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.
  Especially consider the first two items above when the nonlinear solver fails during initialization.

  To get more information consider the options:
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/Generate listing of translated Modelica code in dsmodel.mof
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/List non-linear iteration variables
   * Simulation/Setup/Debug/Store variables after failed initialization
     - If a failure to solve a nonlinear equation caused failed initialization.
   * The options under the group Simulation/Setup/Debug/Nonlinear solver diagnostics

  Jacobian inverse norm estimate: 16659.3
  Condition number estimate: 6850.03
  1-norm of the residual = 52023.2
