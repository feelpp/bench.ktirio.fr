  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - This may be caused by initial conditions not being fully specified, check the translation log.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution, see homotopy in the manual.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.

  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - This may be caused by initial conditions not being fully specified, check the translation log.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution, see homotopy in the manual.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.
  Especially consider the first two items above when the nonlinear solver fails during initialization.
